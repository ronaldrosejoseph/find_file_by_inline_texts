# find_file_by_inline_texts

This program helps you to find the file contain a particular text or some keywords inline or in file.

eg:

print("Sum of a and b is ", a + b, " Which is multiplied by c to get ", (a+b)*c)


My script would help developers to figure out the exact file with the texts, just pass the inline texts.
Here I would pass these texts ["Sum of a and b is", "Which is multiplied by c to get"] and the program would locate the file
